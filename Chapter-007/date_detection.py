# Date Detection
# Write a regular expression that can detect dates in the DD/MM/YYYY format.
# Assume that the days range from 01 to 31,
# the months range from 01 to 12, and
# the years range from 1000 to 2999.
# Note that if the day or month is a single digit, itâ€™ll have a leading zero.

# The regular expression doesnâ€™t have to detect correct days for each month
# or for leap years; it will accept nonexistent dates like 31/02/2020 or 31/04/2021.
#
# Then store these strings into variables named month, day, and year, and
# write additional code that can detect if it is a valid date.
#
# April, June, September, and November have 30 days,
#
# February has 28 days, and the rest of the months have 31 days.
#
# February has 29 days in leap years. Leap years are every year evenly divisible by 4,
# except for years evenly divisible by 100, unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400.
#
# The book says:
# Note how this calculation makes it impossible to make a reasonably sized regular
# expression that can detect a valid date.
#
# This seems questionable. See https://www.regular-expressions.info/dates.html
# which gets a good deal closer than what we do here. At a minimum, their solution
# would reduce false-positives that would need to be weeded out.
