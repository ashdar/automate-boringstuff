# automate-boringstuff
I plan to use this to hold work from a Udemy intro-to-python course called "Automate The Boring Stuff". This class seems well-liked on Reddit, so I might as well start here. Another popular choice seems to be "Think Python". 

I have been programming for decades, mostly in Transact-SQL and PowerShell, but I haven't learned a language from scratch in some time. Many of the languages I worked with and new sort-of-well, at one time, are dead. A few different BASIC dialects, a few Pascal dialects and a thing called "C". 

While I was aware of python 20 years ago, I never really pursued Python learning it. 

With COVID-19 and some 'free time', it's time to try to skill up a bit. Python, R, PowerBI, Tableau and Snowflake all seem to be worth learning. I came across a "free course" offer on Udemy, so I signed up.

I am starting this repository becuase I like revision control systems and I want somewhere to keep my work. I do not expect anyone to use this code.

I'm walking into this a little bit blind: I have no idea how the course is organized or how I will organize the source in this repository.
